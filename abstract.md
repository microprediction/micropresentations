What if you could write an algorithm once that finds its own way to interesting problems to solve,
without the need for human intervention? What if anyone could predict any source of live data by
writing three lines of Python code? I will discuss the potential for collective real-time prediction,
and demonstrate a prototypical host at Microprediction.Org where algorithms predict everything from
electricity prices to cryptocurrencies to helicopter trajectories. Authors of distributional prediction
algorithms are inventized by a kind of lottery paradox.
